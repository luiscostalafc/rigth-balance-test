To test this code you can open the Visual Studio Code console and paste this code there. Afterwards, you can call the reveal() function, passing the coordinates of the cell you want to reveal, for example:

reveal(3, 4);

Then you can call the displayBoard() function to see the current board situation:

displayBoard();

This will display the board with the cell in position (3, 4) revealed and your current situation, whether you won or lost the game.
